    <h1> My description of ping pong </h1> 
        <p> In ping pong there are two players the goal is to get the most amount of points or get a certain amount of points. How you do that is you have to hit the ball to your opponents side and it MUST go both over the net and hit the other side of the table. If you hit the ball and it bounces on your side and Then the other side that is a point for your opponent. If the ball bounces on your side twice that is a point to the other person. To become a master at ping pong is being good at forehand and backhand which is two ways to hit the ball, then you need agility, eye coordination, strength, patience, speed, and finally skill. To play you need a ping pong table, a ping pong ball, two raquets that re designed only for ping pong, and finally a partners or friend or family member or a stranger (I woundn't doing recommend that like seriously!).</p>
